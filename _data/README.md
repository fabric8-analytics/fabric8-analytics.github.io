Well-formatted site data should be placed here.
The Jekyll engine will autoload all data files (using either the `.yml`, `.yaml`, `.json` or `.csv` formats and extensions) in this directory, and they will be accessible via ``site.data``. If there's a file `members.yml` under the directory, then you can access contents of the file through `site.data.members`.
